3. **Push to your fork** and **create a Pull Request**.

   Sure you have the last version of the main branch before push your changes.

   After adding the question using the TUI tool, follow these steps:

   1. Create a new branch for your contribution:
      ```bash
      git checkout -b add-question-{slug}
      ```
      (Replace `{slug}` with the actual slug of your question (or a concise slug version), e.g., `add-question-science-physics-nobel-prize-first-woman-1903`)

   2. Add the updated dataset file:
      ```bash
      git add datasets/general-knowledge/questions.ndjson
      ```

      ```bash
      git commit -m "feat: add {slug}"
      ```

   4. Push to your fork:
      ```bash
      git push origin add-question-{slug}
      ```

   5. Create a Pull Request on GitHub from your branch to the main repository.

4. **CI will automatically**:
   - ✓ Validate all questions
   - ✓ Check for duplicates
   - ✓ Verify all translations
   - ✓ Reject if unwanted files were modified

5. Reviewers will check your PR, may request changes, and finally merge it.

### Important Rules
